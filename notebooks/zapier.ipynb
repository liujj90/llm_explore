The input to this tool is a natural language instruction, for example \"get the latest email from my bank\" or \"send a slack message to the #general channel\". Each tool will have params associated with it that are specified as a list. You MUST take into account the params when creating the instruction. For example, if the params are [\\'Message_Text\\', \\'Channel\\'], your instruction should be something like \\'send a slack message to the #general channel with the text hello world\\'. Another example: if the params are [\\'Calendar\\', \\'Search_Term\\'], your instruction should be something like \\'find the meeting in my personal calendar at 3pm\\'.
