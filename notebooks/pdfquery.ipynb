       " Document(page_content='Over the years, I have always viewed protecting the environment as non-negotiable. When I joined OCBC, my colleagues did not \\nneed convincing.\\nSustainability has long been at the heart of OCBC’s business, anchored on our purpose and values. Particularly, we have stepped up \\nour efforts to combat climate change. In May 2022, for instance, we committed to spending more than SGD 25 million over four years \\nto reduce our carbon footprint from operations in three key markets – Singapore, Malaysia and Greater China. The funds will go to \\ndeploying energy-efficient tech to reduce our emissions and solar energy systems to raise the share of renewables in our energy mix. \\nHowever, the bulk of our efforts – whether as a corporate entity or in daily life – must be conceived of as a collaboration with others. \\nPartnership, in a word, is the most efficient way to magnify the impact of our individual actions. And that has indeed been our approach.\\nSince 2018, we have been proactively engaging our clients to develop and invest in greener assets by offering bespoke sustainable \\nfinancing solutions. We set a target of SGD 10 billion by 2022 for our corporates of all sizes and institutional clients, a target we \\nadjusted in 2022 to SGD 50 billion by 2025. By the end of March this year, we were already at SGD 47 billion. \\nWe have also seen good progress in the OCBC sustainable financing framework for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that \\nwe launched in Nov 2020. This signifies a growing inclusion of sustainability in SMEs’ business strategies and operations that goes \\nbeyond mere awareness.\\nEspecially, given the availability of lower-carbon energy generation technologies, we have made significant headway in the \\nrenewable energy sector, financing solar and wind farm projects worldwide. In tandem, we have worked to reduce greenhouse gas \\n(GHG) emissions caused by burning coal. In April 2019, OCBC was the first Southeast Asian bank to stop financing new coal-fired \\npower plants. In shipping, OCBC remains the only Singapore bank that is a signatory of the Poseidon Principles. \\nAs a leading retail bank in Singapore, we have incentivised individuals to make eco-friendlier consumption choices. Over  \\nSGD 3.5 billion in OCBC Eco-Care loans – paying for homes, renovations and vehicles – has been extended since their introduction \\nin March 2021.“We have now set ambitious, quantitative and science-based Net Zero targets \\nand pathways for emissions arising from our portfolio.

       " Document(page_content='It is just as important for us to support carbon reduction and sequestration community projects big or small. The #OCBCCares for the \\nEnvironment Fund, in which we partner government bodies, advocates, citizen groups, customers and employees to address climate \\nchange, has funded many ground-up projects in Singapore. Our SGD 4 million sponsorship of the OCBC Arboretum at the Singapore \\nBotanic Gardens funds studies and conserves 2,000 dipterocarp trees, the endangered giants of the Southeast Asian rainforests. Our \\nrecent SGD 3 million sponsorship of the OCBC Mangrove Park in Pulau Ubin in Singapore, and one mangrove project in Malaysia’s \\nTebuk Mendeleng, will help grow 18,000 mangrove trees. Our inaugural Singapore Sustainability Innovation Challenge, partnering \\nSATS, solicited innovations world-wide to address food waste arising from air travel.\\nWe will keep building on these efforts. I am therefore pleased to report that – having joined the Net-Zero Banking Alliance in October \\n2022 – we have now set ambitious, quantitative and science-based Net Zero targets and pathways for emissions arising from our \\nportfolio. In effect, we will partner our corporate clients to meaningfully contribute to a Net Zero ASEAN and Greater China  by 2050 \\nin an orderly and just transition. It will be a challenging but meaningful quest. \\nThe six sectors we have set targets for – Power, Oil and Gas, Real Estate, Steel, Aviation and Shipping – represent the most emission \\nintensive sectors that we finance. In addition to our sectoral emission reduction targets, OCBC will not extend project financing to \\nupstream Oil & Gas projects that obtained approval for development after 2021.\\n42% of our corporate and commercial banking loan portfolio falls within the scope of our targets as we focus on parts of the sector \\nvalue chains responsible for the majority of the emissions. The availability of established and credible reference pathways for these \\nsub-sectors is another key consideration. \\nOur sectoral Net Zero targets and pathways are a culmination of months of hard work by many colleagues bankwide and in our core \\nmarkets of ASEAN and Greater China. Beyond the numbers, the project exemplifies key aspects of our vigorously partnership-based \\napproach. We could refer to them as our 4 ‘C’s:\\nCommitment  – Decarbonisation is a multi-stage journey that will take time. To absorb surprises and reverses, unwavering commitment \\nis needed from all stakeholders. \\nCollaboration  – This extends beyond just a fine-grained and continuing partnership with clients and partners to include, internally,  \\na “One Group” approach by OCBC so that every part of the bank is aligned with the effort.\\nCatalyst  – OCBC intends to act as a catalyst of change to guide, navigate and accelerate the transition. As more companies become \\nchange champions for their sectors, transition to Net Zero may even arrive ahead of 2050. \\nCourage  – Giving up profitable businesses takes courage; venturing into new, greener businesses is a leap of faith with  \\nfew guarantees. \\nI firmly maintain that a more sustainable world can be created so long as we are united with our clients and communities in pursuing \\none. Hope can take flight if we take action together – for now and beyond.\\n5\\nOur approach Power Oil & Gas Real Estate Steel Aviation Shipping IntroductionThe way \\nforward\\nMessage from \\nGroup CEO\\nMessage from Group CEO\\nSIGN OFFApproved by Name:\\n12.05.2023', metadata={'source': '../data/ocbc_net_zero_report.pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='As a financial institution, we aim to excel for sustainable growth, and driving the transition to a sustainable low-\\ncarbon world is our core strategic pillar. Increasing investment in greener activities is key, as is creating credible \\ntransition pathways for high-emissions, essential economic sectors such as power and metals; we need \\nelectricity to keep our societies and economy humming and steel for the construction of critical infrastructure. \\nOne priority is to redirect capital from high-emissions technology and processes to low- or zero-emissions \\nones, particularly in sectors where such technologies and ecosystems already exist.\\nBuilding on our sustainability efforts, we are now setting ambitious, quantitative, and credible decarbonisation \\ntargets for emissions arising from our portfolio (our “Net Zero targets”, or “targets”). As a financial institution, our \\nScope 3 emissions – particularly our financed emissions – are the most material. We recognise that we have a \\nrole to play, and we are now setting Net Zero targets with the goal of reducing these emissions by partnering \\nwith our clients, thereby directing capital to facilitate meaningful change in the real economy.\\nFor OCBC, we are setting targets for three key reasons:\\n1. Financing the transition is simply the responsible thing to do. The consequences of doing too little for the \\nsocieties that we serve, especially future generations without the means to adequately adapt, are dire. The \\nbrunt of delayed action will be most acutely felt by people in our core markets. Through these targets, we \\nsignal our commitment to working with our clients and the governments where we operate to ensure \\nthis happens.\\n2. Climate transition is an aspiration of our clients. Our purpose is to help our clients achieve their aspirations \\nwith innovative financing. Increasingly, those aspirations include transitioning their businesses towards \\nlow- or zero-emissions technologies. Climate transition is a megatrend that is shaping the next great \\nindustrial revolution; by supporting that change, we believe we are helping to shape the future.\\n3. Supporting the climate transition is sound risk management. Climate change can cause financial and \\nreputational risks for the financial sector. As decarbonisation gathers momentum, clients in carbon- \\nintensive and hard-to-abate sectors could face greater pressures from more stringent climate policies, \\nchanges in technology standards, and shifts in demand patterns. Understanding and monitoring climate \\nrisks faced by our clients and helping them succeed in this transition is in line with our approach for \\nprudent risk management.\\nAs a key element of our business strategy, the Net Zero commitments will: \\n• Ensure we stay focused on the areas where our actions are most impactful, identifying opportunities that \\nwe can help realise as a financing partner.\\n• Enable us to engage our clients on the basis of credible science-based decarbonisation pathways and a \\ndata-driven approach, giving us confidence in our clients’ transition efforts; and \\n• Provide a benchmark for external stakeholders to hold us accountable.

       " Document(page_content='2.1 Our principles\\nThe path to Net Zero is sector-specific, given the different levels of technological maturity and action required \\nin each sector. To ensure coherence while reflecting that sector-specificity, we have adopted a consistent \\napproach overall and then tailored it to each sector. Throughout our Net Zero target setting exercise, we have \\nbeen guided by the following key principles:\\n• Grounding our Net Zero targets in climate science. Our goal is to support the global transition to Net Zero \\nby 2050 to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, based on the climate research. We \\nhave adopted internationally recognised, science-based pathways aligned with this scenario, which is \\nmore ambitious than the Net Zero pledges of several countries we operate in.\\n• Interim targets for 2030. Transition pathways that limit global warming to 1.5°C require rapid action during \\nthis decade. We have set 2030 as an interim checkpoint to ensure we are on track towards our ultimate \\n2050 goal.\\n• Sector-specific targets. Each sector has its unique challenges and characteristics, giving rise to distinct \\ntransition pathways. We have assessed our financed emissions and set decarbonisation targets at a \\nsectoral level, using sector-specific metrics. \\n• Prioritising actions we can take with our clients. We have identified various levers to support clients in their \\ntransition. Even within a given sector, there is no one-size-fits-all solution since factors such as our clients’ \\nown decarbonisation targets, understanding of assets that need to transition, and historic trends and \\ngovernment plans in each market may play a role. We conducted analyses to identify the optimal levers \\nunder various assumptions to prioritise our actions and develop strategies for each sector. \\n• Searching for opportunities that enable economic growth as well as promote Net Zero. We have set \\ntargets that focus on the decarbonisation agenda while enabling the growth of a greener economy. \\nGiven that we primarily serve a region that is rapidly developing, there would be social implications arising \\nfrom the transition. We believe the path to Net Zero is compatible with continued economic growth and \\nprosperity for all.\\n2.2 Standards and guidelines\\nIn setting our targets, we have been guided by the following:\\n Net-Zero Banking Alliance \\nThe NZBA was launched by the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) in April \\n2021. It is an alliance of banks committed to aligning their lending and investment portfolios with Net Zero \\nemissions by 2050. NZBA reinforces, accelerates and supports the implementation of decarbonisation \\nstrategies, providing an internationally coherent framework and guidelines in which to operate, supported by \\npeer-learning from member banks.

Calculating our emissions baselines and identifying the reference pathways for each sector. These \\nbaselines comprise of the current starting-point emissions from our portfolio and a projection of and how \\nthese emissions might evolve. Thereafter, we identified reference pathways for each sector, with which \\nwe compared our projections, to determine the magnitude of any gaps between where our portfolio \\nmay move to and where the reference pathways show it needs to be.\\n3. Setting our strategy to get to Net Zero. For each sector, we identified the key decarbonisation drivers and \\nconducted impact analyses to understand what actions we could take to meet our 2030 interim targets \\nand 2050 targets. These actions then formed the basis of our strategy for each sector.\\n4. Finalising our targets. This was a collective decision-making process involving all relevant internal \\nstakeholders including our business and risk management teams. The targets were endorsed at the \\nhighest levels, by OCBC’s senior management team and the Board Sustainability Committee. 2.3 Our approach Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials\\nThe Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) is an industry-led initiative enabling financial institutions \\nto measure and disclose GHG emissions associated with loans and investments. PCAF has developed a \\nmethodology for calculating financed emissions, in line with requirements set by GHG Protocol (Protocol). In \\nthis set of targets, we have taken guidance from PCAF’s methodology in measuring emissions, especially for \\nthe Oil & Gas sector where we measure absolute emissions, and in the way that we have prioritised data \\nsources.\\n Poseidon Principles\\nFor the Shipping sector, our target-setting and disclosure is guided by technical guidance from the Poseidon \\nPrinciples (PP). The Poseidon Principles are a set of guidelines developed by banks to promote environmentally \\nsustainable shipping practices. The technical guidance from PP includes requirements for shipping lenders to \\nassess and disclose the carbon intensity of their portfolio of loans to individual ships, as well as to set \\ndecarbonisation targets that align with the International Maritime Organisation (IMO)’s ambition of reducing \\ntotal annual GHG emissions by at least 50% by 2050 based on 2008 levels.\\nOur disclosure on our shipping portfolio for 2021 can be found in the annual progress report https://www. \\nposeidonprinciples.org/finance/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Poseidon-Principles-Annual-Disclosure- \\nReport-2022.pdf .\\n16\\nPower Oil & Gas Real Estate Steel Aviation Shipping IntroductionMessage from \\nGroup CEOThe way \\nforward\\nOur approach\\nChapter 2: Our approach', metadata={'source': '../data/ocbc_net_zero_report.pdf', 'page': 15}),\n",

As a member, we \\nhave set targets for the most carbon intensive sectors where data and methodologies allow. It is hard to \\nprecisely attribute annual global GHG emissions to specific industries as emissions can be double-counted. \\nFor instance, the Power and Oil & Gas sectors have impacts that go beyond their own sector boundaries \\nas other sectors depend upon them, so their GHG emissions are often attributed both to them and to the \\nend user of the energy they create. The World Resources Institute (WRI) reports that, globally, the Power \\nand Oil & Gas sectors account for more than 75% of annual GHG emissions4. Meanwhile, the other four \\nsectors that we have set targets for account for 28% of GHG emissions, most of which may be double- \\ncounted with Power and Oil & Gas sector GHG emissions (Figure 1). \\n3 NZBA requires target setting on the following sectors: agriculture; aluminium; cement; coal; commercial and residential real estate; iron and steel; oil and gas; \\npower generation; and transport.\\n4 World Resources Institute, “World Greenhouse Gas Emissions: 2019”, (2022), https://www.wri.org/data/world-greenhouse-gas-emissions-2019Source: World Resources Institute – World Greenhouse Gas Emissions: 2019 ( https://www.wri.org/data/world-greenhouse-gas-emissions-2019 )Figure 1: Global greenhouse gas emissions by key sectors in 2019\\n(% of GtCO 2e)\\n17\\nPower Oil & Gas Real Estate Steel Aviation Shipping IntroductionMessage from \\nGroup CEOThe way \\nforward\\nOur approach\\nChapter 2: Our approach', metadata={'source': '../data/ocbc_net_zero_report.pdf', 'page': 16}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='• Materiality of the sector in the OCBC portfolio\\nWe seek to address a large proportion of our portfolio; 42% of our corporate and commercial banking \\nloan portfolio5 is captured within the scope of our targets.\\nSelection of value chain within the sector\\nWithin each sector, we have focused our targets on specific parts of the sector value chains based on the \\nfollowing considerations:\\n• In each sector, what is the sub-sector that is the most critical to decarbonise? In each sector, we have \\nidentified the sub-sectors responsible for the majority of the emissions in that sector. For example, we \\nfocused on electricity generation in the Power sector and not on transmission grids, as the bulk of emissions \\nin the Power sector arise from the generation of electricity6. By decarbonising the power generation sub-\\nsector, a vast majority of emissions in the overall Power sector will be removed;\\n• What do the sector-specific reference pathways seek to measure and address? Within a sector, reference \\npathways are typically established for a sub-sector that is critical for sector decarbonisation. For example, \\nAviation sector reference pathways focus on emissions from aircraft burning jet fuel, and not from airport \\ninfrastructure; and\\n• Which data is available for each sector? Emissions reporting is a relatively young practice, and our targets \\nare limited by the availability of data. For example, in Real Estate sector, we are not yet able to set a robust \\ntarget for embodied emissions, which result from the use of raw materials in construction.\\nScope of GHG emissions\\nWe have followed the definitions of GHG emissions outlined by the Protocol, a widely recognised standard for \\naccounting and reporting GHG emissions developed by the WRI and the World Business Council for Sustainable \\nDevelopment (WBCSD). The Protocol splits GHG emissions into three scopes (Figure 2):\\n• Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions from sources that are owned and controlled by the organisation. \\nThese typically include emissions from combustion of fossil fuels in vehicles or generators for heat \\nand electricity;\\n• Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions from the generation of purchased electricity, heat or steam used \\nby the organisation; and\\n• Scope 3 emissions are all the other indirect emissions that occur in the organisation’s value chain, both \\nupstream and downstream. Financed emissions are typically the most significant Scope 3 emissions of \\nfinancial institutions. \\nCompanies wishing to manage their GHG emissions typically start with Scope 1 and 2 emissions, since these \\nare the most directly under their control. However, to fully understand the overall impact on the environment, \\nassessing Scope 3 emissions is critical, especially for sectors such as Oil & Gas, as this enables companies to \\nunderstand and reduce their wider impact. We have evaluated sector-by-sector what should be included in \\neach of our sector targets based on where the material source of each sector’s emissions is, and where our \\nclients are able to make an impact.\\n5 Defined as our total exposure to corporate and SME clients, excluding financial institutions and sovereign borrowers. \\n6 We recognise the key role that transmission grids play in decarbonising power generation – in many countries this is a central effort as it allows power to be \\ndistributed from areas with high access to renewable energy to the rest of the country. We do and will continue to support the extension of these grids. \\nExcluding them from our targets, however, reflects that our focus should not be on decarbonisation of those grids, but on their extension.\\n18\\nPower Oil & Gas Real Estate Steel Aviation Shipping IntroductionMessage from \\nGroup CEOThe way \\nforward\\nOur approach\\nChapter 2: Our approach', metadata={'source': '../data/ocbc_net_zero_report.pdf', 'page': 17}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Accounting for emissions using the three scopes creates double counting in some instances. For example, \\nnatural gas is supplied by our Oil & Gas clients to our Power generation clients, who then burn the gas to \\ngenerate power that they in turn provide to our Real Estate clients. The emissions generated by the burning of \\nthe gas are made only once in reality, but in our scoping, they are included three times – as the downstream \\nScope 3 emissions of our Oil & Gas clients, as the Scope 1 emissions of our Power generation clients, and as \\nthe Scope 2 emissions of our Real Estate clients. \\nWe made no attempt to strip out this double counting. Instead, our target setting approach works on \\ndecarbonisation at all three stages – we reduce emissions by working with our clients to improve the energy \\nefficiency of buildings, to replace gas with renewables in power generation, and to limit the extraction of \\nnatural gas by Oil & Gas companies. Rather than being a pitfall of our methodology, we believe that the double \\ncounting of emissions is beneficial to our aim as it provides us with a holistic view of the actions we can take in \\neach sector, and how their inter-relationships can impact decarbonisation across sectors at a portfolio level.\\nProducts and portfolio\\nThe NZBA guidelines stipulate that we calculate our financed emissions for lending and investment activities \\nwhen setting our targets.

       " Document(page_content='2.3.2 Metrics \\nWe have chosen different emissions metrics for each of the sector targets to align with the best ways we can \\nsupport decarbonising each sector. In this section, we outline the three types of metrics that we have used for \\nour exercise.\\nPhysical emissions intensity metrics:\\nWe used physical emissions intensity metrics for the Aviation, Power, and Steel sectors. The path to Net Zero \\nin these sectors requires both a reduction of emissions as well as a continuation, or even growth, of activity to \\nincrease the output of goods and services needed by society. In these sectors, we are therefore targeting a \\nreduction in physical emissions intensity in order not to constrain the output of the sector, provided that \\ndecarbonisation is sufficiently rapid. This metric measures the volume of emissions per unit of the relevant product \\nor output for the sector such as megawatt-hour in the Power sector, and tonnes of steel in the Steel sector.\\nBy setting a target to reduce the intensity, we are committing to supporting our clients to decarbonise their \\nbusinesses, and committing to steering our financing towards those with lower emissions intensity. We see this \\nmetric as most consistent with our dual objectives to support decarbonisation and economic growth.\\nAlignment delta\\nFor the Shipping and Real Estate sectors, we have expanded on the physical emissions intensity metric to use \\nan alignment delta (AD) metric. This is a variant on the physical emissions intensity approach, and is designed \\nfor highly heterogenous sectors; it was originally developed as part of the Poseidon Principles approach for \\ndecarbonising shipping portfolios.\\nThe approach can be applied to sectors where the underlying assets have highly diverging levels of emissions \\nintensity and are not substitutes for each other. For example, a hotel in Hong Kong will have different emissions \\nto an office building in Singapore, and they cannot replace each other; the decarbonisation reference pathway \\nfor each asset is also different as a result. \\nTo calculate the AD of the portfolio, the physical emissions intensity of each client is first measured. This is then \\ncompared to a specific reference pathway for that client based on the type of asset that it owns or operates \\nto calculate the AD of the client, i.e. in percentage terms, how far above or below the reference pathway the \\nclient’s physical emissions intensity is. The portfolio AD then summarises these individual comparisons by \\naveraging them across the portfolio, weighting by exposure to each client.\\nThe advantage of using this metric is that it allows comparison of clients to their appropriate reference \\npathways. This avoids building an unintended incentive into our target that enables us to achieve our target by \\nswitching to bank lower-emissions types of properties or vessels, rather than focusing on helping our clients to \\ndecarbonise the types of properties and vessels they own or operate.Physical emissions intensity calculation for portfolio\\nPhysical emissions intensity of portfolio (x p) = ∑i (xi ×ei) (Equation 1)ep\\nWhere: xi=emissions intensity of a client i\\nei=OCBC’s exposure to a given client i\\nep=OCBC’s exposure to the in-scope portfolio for the sector\\n20\\nPower Oil & Gas Real Estate Steel Aviation Shipping IntroductionMessage from \\nGroup CEOThe way \\nforward\\nOur approach\\nChapter 2: Our approach', metadata={'source': '../data/ocbc_net_zero_report.pdf', 'page': 19}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Absolute emissions\\nFor the Oil & Gas sector, we have set our target as a reduction in absolute emissions.

We have measured the absolute emissions following the PCAF financed emissions \\ncalculation approach, with the following modifications. \\nFirstly, for purpose of calculating the share of a client’s emissions that is attributed to us, we used the total assets \\nof our clients, rather than the enterprise value for public companies, for consistency and to mute the impacts \\nfrom year-on-year share price volatility. Secondly, we also measured emissions using our total commitment to \\nour clients, including undrawn limits.

This will help provide consistency for our teams, and for our clients \\nwhom we will be engaging on our targets.\\nAs a Singapore headquartered bank, our portfolio has a strong Asian footprint with significant exposure to \\nemerging markets. However, we are cognisant that the effects of climate change are global in nature. When \\nselecting reference pathways, we have taken a balanced approach in choosing between global and regional \\nreference pathways. For sectors that are highly localised with production occurring in specific locations, we \\nhave generally used regional reference pathways. For instance, steel mill and real estate assets are fixed, and \\nso we have selected regional pathways to reflect the required pace of decarbonisation in our clients’ markets. \\nFor sectors that are more global in nature, we have selected global pathways. Aviation and shipping companies’ \\nemissions are made internationally, while Oil & Gas companies sell their products globally. \\nThe Power sector is the only one which does not follow the general approach outlined above. Here, we have \\nselected a global pathway, notwithstanding that power is generated and consumed locally. Regional reference \\npathways for emissions from power generation vary greatly, such that we do not feel comfortable selecting \\namong them. Choosing a global reference pathway is a pragmatic choice, also an ambitious one with regard \\nto achieving our global decarbonisation objective. Asian power grids are widely expected to decarbonise \\nmore slowly than those in many western markets, so by selecting a global pathway, we are committing to \\npushing a faster and more aggressive power transition in Asia.

       " Document(page_content='2.3.4 Data \\nEmissions reporting has made significant advances in recent years – the development of reporting standards \\nby the Taskforce for Climate related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and efforts by regulators, stock exchanges \\nand governments to make this a requirement has greatly increased the availability of emissions data. Industry \\nregulators such as national building authorities have increasingly required emissions and energy efficiency \\nreporting, and have updated standards. However, it remains a challenge to collect comprehensive and \\naccurate data. Many companies, especially smaller ones, have not yet started reporting emissions and \\nstandards, and scope of emissions data can differ across companies. Additionally, we often finance only \\nspecific activities (trade, project development, etc.) of a company, or specific legal entities, that have very \\ndifferent emissions profiles to the parent; in such instances, data remains a challenge when it is available only \\nat a parent level, but not at an activity or subsidiary level.\\nPCAF guides banks to use the highest quality emissions data available, giving guidelines on what constitutes \\ndifferent levels of quality. But it also recognises that data availability should not be an excuse to delay action, \\nand guides that data quality can be improved over time. To get to the most accurate possible baseline position, \\nwe have therefore used a combination of data sources:\\n• Where available, we have used asset-level emissions data as this enables an accurate and consistent way \\nof assessing clients’ emissions profiles;\\n• Where companies are reporting their emissions, and this is provided at the same level as our financing, we \\nhave used that data;\\n• In some cases where borrowing entity level data is not available, we have taken the reported emissions \\nof the parent as a proxy; and\\n• Where no other data is available, we have used proxies based on national or regional averages for the \\nsector or asset class.\\nWhere possible, we used 2021 data, which was the latest GHG emissions data at the point that we calculated \\nour baselines. For some clients whose 2021 data was not available, we used the data from the closest possible \\nyear. For consistency, we used a year-end 2021 snapshot of our portfolio to compute our exposures to clients.\\n2.3.5 Use of carbon credits\\nWe believe that high quality carbon credits will play a role in addressing hard-to-abate emissions. For instance, \\nin the aviation industry, sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) will take several years to become widely available as \\nproduction is currently low. In the interim, quality carbon credits could play a role in decarbonising Aviation \\nsector. More broadly, carbon credits can be an important mechanism for companies which are themselves \\nnot in high-emitting industries but want to take climate action and contribute to decarbonisation efforts as it \\ncan bring necessary capital for carbon credit generating projects (e.g., accounting firms buying carbon credits \\nto offset their emissions). Through such actions, capital is brought to carbon credit generating projects.\\nCarbon credits can however be controversial, especially in cases where poor-quality credits have been \\ngenerated for activities that would have occurred even in the absence of such credits, thus giving a false sense \\nof comfort on overall emissions. Carbon credits should not be used as an excuse to avoid or delay technological \\nchange required where the technologies are available and economically viable.\\nGiven the immaturity of the market for such credits, we have not included them in our initial assessment. That \\nsaid, we may in time relook at the possibility of our clients using high-quality carbon credits to reduce their \\nreported emissions, should there be more guidance from industry bodies on the subject.\\n23\\nPower Oil & Gas Real Estate Steel Aviation Shipping IntroductionMessage from \\nGroup CEOThe way \\nforward\\nOur approach\\nChapter 2: Our approach', metadata={'source': '../data/ocbc_net_zero_report.pdf', 'page': 22}),\n",

This means that where our portfolio starts above the \\nreference pathway, we need to decarbonise our portfolio faster than the chosen pathway over the coming \\ndecade; conversely where our portfolio baseline is lower than the starting reference pathway, we may be able \\nto pursue decarbonisation at a more gradual pace, recognising the prior efforts that we have already expended \\nto transition our portfolio.\\nFor the Oil & Gas sector, where the targets are set based on absolute financed emissions, the level of the 2030 \\npoint is not set directly by the reference pathway. Rather, our 2030 target is to reduce financed emissions of \\nour portfolio by 35% from its level at the end of 2021. \\n Beyond 2030\\nIn the longer-term, committing to Net Zero involves navigating numerous uncertainties and lesser-known \\ntrajectories to the Bank. We recognise that achieving Net Zero targets is a long-term journey that will require \\nus to continuously adapt and learn from the process. To help navigate this journey, we have developed four \\nguiding principles that inform our approach to achieve Net Zero.

Working together with our clients for their transition is our key priority. \\n• For clients that are at an early stage of their decarbonisation journey or where their current ambitions \\nare not fully aligned with our Net Zero targets, we want to help them set decarbonisation plans with \\nconfidence. That will mean increasing our transition advisory support to clients, especially smaller \\nclients for whom this can be a daunting task.\\n• For clients that are already making ambitious plans of their own, we are reinforcing our commitment \\nto support them to achieve and over-achieve their goals by offering the necessary financing.

The road to Net Zero will necessitate the innovation of new technologies, improvement \\nof emerging technologies, and massive scaling up of existing technologies.

At OCBC, we will \\ndirect capital towards technologies that enable the massive scaling up of renewable energy and \\ntheir supporting infrastructure.\\n3.1 Sector dynamics\\nPower is a cornerstone of our economy and society, with our daily lives, infrastructure, and economic \\ndevelopment heavily reliant on it. Global electricity demand reached 24,700 Terawatt hour (TWh) in 2021, and \\nis projected to grow at 3.5% annually on average through 2050 under the IEA NZE scenario8. \\nAccess to affordable and reliable electricity has vast impacts on a wide range of development indicators, \\nincluding health, education, food security, equality, livelihoods, and poverty reduction. This is especially \\nprominent in developing markets, many of which are in our core Asian markets.\\nThe growing global population, urbanisation and socio-economic development in developing economies will \\ndrive an increase in demand for power. Furthermore, a shift to electrification of other industries that are currently \\nreliant on direct combustion of fossil fuels, such as transportation and steel manufacturing, will significantly add to \\npower demand. The Special Report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) forecasts that \\nelectricity will have to power up to 71% of total energy end use by 2050 to align with 1.5°C pathways with no or \\nlimited overshoot, and that electricity will need to be generated with zero carbon emissions9.\\nMuch of the technology required to generate zero-carbon electricity has already been developed and shown \\nto be viable at scale. In Asia, 25.3% of power was generated from renewable sources in 2021, up from 13.3% in \\n200010. This comes at a time where the levelised cost of production for renewable energy sources has fallen \\nsteadily, such that in 2022, many were on par with traditional fossil fuel sources (Figure 3).

This \\nwould mean a 35% reduction in our financed emissions by 2030, and ultimately a 95% reduction in our financed \\nemissions by 2050.\\nTarget 2\\nWe will not extend project financing to upstream Oil & Gas projects that obtained approval for development \\nafter 2021.

We currently rely heavily on oil and gas for our power generation, transportation system and \\nmanufacturing. The fossil fuel tap cannot be turned off overnight – we need continued supply to support an \\norderly transition. \\nHowever, traditional Oil & Gas companies will need to pivot their businesses to stay relevant in a world where \\nfossil fuels will be phased out by 2050. Some of our clients have started this transition and some have disclosed \\nambitious transition pathways. Others have made a start by pledging to reduce or eradicate the use of flaring \\nin their standard operations, while some companies are diversifying their businesses steadily away from \\nfossil fuels. Their technical expertise and financial capacities in the sector give us confidence of successful \\npivots to future areas of impact, from alternative fuels (e.g., SAF, green hydrogen, and green ammonia) to \\nCCUS technologies.\\nWe stand ready to support the diversification of our Oil & Gas clients’ businesses into cleaner energy sources \\nand leveraging the right resources and technologies to future-proof their businesses. We do not expect full \\ntransition away from oil and gas by 2030, but it is important that we have a robust 2030 target to ensure we are \\non the right trajectory to reach Net Zero by 2050.\\nOCBC’s efforts in supporting our clients’ full transition away from oil and gas ultimately relies on an eventual \\nvoid in the demand for oil and gas products.

Emissions are generated \\nthroughout a building’s life cycle:\\n• During construction, emissions are generated directly through the use of diesel trucks and power generators. \\nThey are also generated indirectly through the use of steel, cement and other materials that themselves \\nrelied on heavy emitting processes to manufacture, and through use of electricity provided through the grid;\\n• During the operation of buildings, Real Estate is responsible for direct emissions where fuels such as natural \\ngas are burnt for heating, and indirectly through the use of electricity purchased from the grid; and\\n• The demolition process also directly generates emissions, and contributes to the emissions from raw \\nmaterials where these are not recycled.\\nReal Estate thus grows emissions through the increase in total building stock and the operation intensity of \\nexisting buildings. Much of global growth in Real Estate is taking place within our core markets in Asia, where \\nurban populations have increased from 20% of the population in 1950 to 50% in 2016. Urbanisation is expected \\nto reach 64% in 2050. In absolute terms, the urban population in Asia is projected to increase from approximately \\n1.7 billion people today to 2.26 billion in 2030, and 2.75 billion in 205025.

This method, commonly known as DRI-EAF, accounts for \\napproximately 4% of current global steel production31, but is expected to grow as it has great potential for \\nemissions reduction if the syngas used to reduce the iron is replaced with green hydrogen.\\nSecondary steel is largely made by melting scrap iron using EAFs to renew the steel and allow it to be re-cast \\ninto crude steel. EAF secondary steel production has much lower GHG emissions intensity than the BF-BOF \\nprocess, especially when the underlying electricity used is generated from renewable energy sources. \\nHowever, manufacturing of secondary steel is limited by the amount of scrap that can be recycled. There is \\ncurrently only limited scope to increase scrap availability as steel demand is growing at a faster rate than scrap \\nis being released from the pool of ‘steel in use’32.\\nOverall, the need to transition is much greater for primary steel producers using BF-BOF technology.\\n30 Based on analysis of steel plants included in the Global Steel Plants Tracker (GSPT), Global Energy Monitor\\n31 Based on analysis of steel plants included in the Global Steel Plants Tracker (GSPT), Global Energy Monitor\\n32 Worldsteel Association, “Fact sheet: Scrap use in the steel industry”, May 2021, https://worldsteel.org/wp-content/uploads/Fact-sheet-on-scrap_2021.pdfSource: Worldsteel – World Steel in Figures 2022 ( https://worldsteel.org/steel-topics/statistics/world-steel-in-figures-2022/ )Figure 18: Crude steel production and geographical distribution, 2021\\n China 53%\\n Other Asia 8%\\n EU 8%\\n India 6%\\n US/Canada/Mexico 6%\\n Russia and CIS countries 5%\\n Japan 5%\\n Other Europe 3%\\n Other 6%Global total:\\n1,951 Mt\\n53\\nOur approach Power Oil & Gas Real Estate Aviation Shipping IntroductionMessage from \\nGroup CEOThe way \\nforward\\nSteel\\nChapter 6: Steel', metadata={'source': '../data/ocbc_net_zero_report.pdf', 'page': 52}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='Scope of our targets\\nPP requires the Bank to measure the emissions intensity of all the ocean-going ships that we directly finance.\\nMetrics\\nShips’ emissions intensities, or Annual Efficiency Ratios (AERs), are measured as CO 2 emissions from fuel-burn \\nper deadweight tonne-nautical mile (DWT-NM)55. DWT-NM is measured to normalise for differences in \\nemissions due to differences in ship size and load, as larger and more fully laden ships have higher fuel-burn \\nemissions, but also carry more goods or passengers. \\nIn comparing the vessels’ emissions intensities with the reference pathways that PP publishes, we use the AD \\nmetric. This metric calculates the percentage difference between the emissions intensity of each ship and the \\nrelevant reference pathway emissions intensity for that ship’s type and size. These ship-level ADs are exposure-\\nweighted and aggregated across the portfolio to derive a portfolio-level AD that normalises across different \\nship types and sizes in our shipping portfolio. Similar to the Real Estate sector, each type and size of vessel has \\nits unique usage, and they are not inter-changeable. Using AD helps us understand and consolidate our \\nportfolio’s emissions profiles without bias coming from changing composition of our shipping portfolio.\\nReference pathway\\nOur Shipping sector target is to align with or outperform the IMO’s shipping decarbonisation pathway (i.e., \\nkeep our portfolio-level alignment delta at or below 0%), in line with the ambitions of the PP. We are cognisant \\nthat the IMO trajectory is currently not aligned with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature goal. We have \\ntherefore expressed our willingness, together with the other signatories, to adopt an appropriate emissions \\nreduction trajectory in line with Net Zero targets for the Shipping sector as soon as such a trajectory or \\ntrajectories become readily available56. At which point, we will work towards measuring our alignment delta \\nagainst the revised reference pathways.\\nOur baseline and targets\\nFor 2021, we were slightly above the reference by 4.5% (compared to an alignment of -1.8% in 2020) for two \\nmain reasons. Firstly, due to the changing consumption patterns during COVID-19, liners operated at higher \\nspeeds to meet an unprecedented increase in e-commerce activity while port congestion due to lockdowns \\nand labour shortage added to longer waiting times. Secondly, there was a misalignment for shuttle tankers due \\nto the nature of the business where these tankers perform shorter lightering runs. Overall, signatories reported \\na less favourable average score of +9.7% in 2021 (compared to +7% in 2020) as a result of COVID-19 induced \\nimpact on shipping.\\n55 For Cruise, Ferry-RoPax, Ferry-pax only and Vehicle, the denominator of carbon intensity is Gt*nm where Gt is gross tonnage instead of DWT*nm.\\n56 Poseidon Principles, “Leading shipping banks and maritime insurers pave the way for 1.5-aligned emissions benchmarking”, 22 September 2022,  \\nhttps://www.poseidonprinciples.org/finance/news/leading-shipping-banks-and-marine-insurers-pave-the-way-for-1-5-aligned-emissions-benchmarking/\\n66\\nOur approach Power Oil & Gas Real Estate Steel Aviation IntroductionMessage from \\nGroup CEOThe way \\nforward\\nShipping\\nChapter 8: Shipping', metadata={'source': '../data/ocbc_net_zero_report.pdf', 'page': 65}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='Low carbon alternative fuels \\nKey for the Shipping sector is to find commercially viable clean fuels that can move large vessels across the \\nocean safely. Various alternative fuels are currently being adopted, including LNG, ammonia, biofuels, \\nhydrogen, and methanol. \\nWhile LNG is cleaner than bunker fuels, it is still a fossil fuel and there have been concerns around potential \\nleakage of unburned methane (i.e. “methane slip”) from the use of LNG-fuelled ships. LNG is therefore \\nconsidered at best a transition fuel. \\nAmmonia does not release any CO 2 when burnt and can potentially be a long-term solution. However at \\npresent, the production of ammonia usually involves chemical processes that themselves create a large \\namount of GHG emissions. This is both from the high heat and pressure used to drive the chemical reaction, as \\nwell as from the production of hydrogen that it uses. Emissions from this process can be greatly reduced with \\ngreen hydrogen, production of which requires a surplus of renewable energy, giving rise to a dependency of \\nShipping sector decarbonisation on decarbonisation of the Power sector. Ammonia also releases less energy \\nper litre burnt as compared to bunker fuel and requires catalysts to work efficiently in engines, of which the \\ndevelopment is still in the works. Therefore, switching the Shipping sector to widespread use of ammonia as a \\nfuel is unlikely to occur soon. \\nAnother alternative fuel is methanol which is easier to store and presents fewer pollution risks compared \\nto ammonia. However, producing green methanol is an energy intensive process that also requires a \\nsurplus of renewable energy. In addition, it relies on capturing CO 2 from the atmosphere which is still an \\nimmature technology. \\nBiofuels are an attractive alternative as they are “drop-in fuels”, meaning they can directly replace like-for-like \\nbunker fuel and can be used in the short-term to reduce emissions. However, production of biofuels is currently \\nlimited and, coupled with the Aviation sector’s demand for SAF, it is unlikely that biofuels will be able to \\nsufficiently meet the demands of the Shipping sector in the near future. \\nUse of batteries to power ships are also being tested, however battery-powered ships that are available presently \\nhave limitations on both the size of the ship they can power and in the distance that they are able to cover. \\nAlthough it may take some time before we have commercially viable low carbon vessel technologies, it is \\nheartening to see all parties including industry players, governments and academics mobilising their resources \\nto develop technologies. We will support our current and potential clients by funding investments relating to \\nthe research, retrofit and purchase of alternative fuels. \\nRetrofitting existing ships \\nAs of March 2023, the global merchant fleet had an average vessel age of over 12 years57. Due to the long \\neconomic lifespan of ships, retrofitting existing ships is critical to emissions reduction in the short term. \\nCommon retrofit energy efficiency measures include: \\n• Retrofitting of existing vessel’s engines to become dual-fuel engines that are able to run on alternative \\nfuels as well;\\n• Improvements to the ship design such as engine derating to adjust the fuel injection time and reconfiguration \\nof the bulbous bow to reduce wave-making resistance; and\\n• Improvements to ship propulsion such as installation of winglets to improve propeller efficiency and sails \\nto harness wind power.\\nWe will continue to incentivise current and potential clients to seek further optimisation and improvements in \\nefficiency through innovative financing solutions.\\n57 Clarksons Research, “Shipping Intelligence Network”, https://sin.clarksons.net/\\n68\\nOur approach Power Oil & Gas Real Estate Steel Aviation IntroductionMessage from \\nGroup CEOThe way \\nforward\\nShipping\\nChapter 8: Shipping', metadata={'source': '../data/ocbc_net_zero_report.pdf', 'page': 67}),\n",
